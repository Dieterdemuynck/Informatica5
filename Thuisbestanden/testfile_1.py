# Idea: Make a tiny RPG-game through python.
# Images are not necessary, therefor try to make it through text only.

### POINT SYSTEM ###
# HP: Health Points of a character.
# MP: Magic Points (used for spells).
# LP: Luck Points, these will determine your "luck" with random-chance-encounters and looting chests, etc.

### EXTRA IDEAS ###
# Items: You can find items such as weapons, scrolls, armor, etc in chests or from loot drops, for use in combat.
# LV: Level of a character. These determine the strength of someone's attacks, defense, etc.

### GENERAL GAMEPLAY ###
# Still up for decision:
#   Pick a "class" and a number of monsters to fight
#       The player gets his stats through his class, can upgrade a little between each fight.
